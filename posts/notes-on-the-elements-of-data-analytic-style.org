* What's this then?
  These are my notes on [[https://leanpub.com/datastyle][The Elements Of Data Analytic Style]], by Jeff Leek. I first encountered it while taking the [[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science][John Hopkins Data Science Specialization]] (which I eventually dropped because I was turned off by R, maybe I'll take it up again and use [[https://pypi.org/project/rpy2/][rpy2]], or maybe not).
* What is the data analytic question?
  Before doing a data analysis you should give a broad categorization for the question you are trying to answer using your analysis. This doesn't ask what the question is, specifically, but rather it gives your question a type.
** Define the data analytic question first

** What is a descriptive data analysis?
   A *descriptive data analysis* attempts to summarize the data as a value without interpreting what it means. The [[https://www.census.gov/][U.S. Census]] is an example of a descriptive analysis. They provide summary statistics about subjects like the population, the economy, etc. but they leave it to other people to interpret what the numbers mean.
** What is an exploratory data analysis?
   An *exploratory data analysis* extends a descriptive data analysis by looking for interesting things within the data.
** What is an inferential data analysis?
   An *inferential data analysis* tries to give the probability that a discovery made in an exploratory data analysis will hold if a new sample is collected.
** What is a predictive data analysis?
   While an inferential data analysis tries to quantify existing relationships within a population a *predictive data analysis* attempts to predict an outcome based on some other measured data. Finding that unemployed males voted more frequently for a candidate is inferential, predicting that unemployed males will vote for a certain candidate based on polling data is the outcome of a predictive data analysis.
** What is a causal data analysis?
   A *causal data analysis* tries to find out what would happen to one measurement if you make a change to another. /If you introduce a treatement, will the outcome be different from the control group that didn't get the treatment?/
** What is a mechanistic data analysis?
   Causal data analysis uses probablity to infer relationships, you are trying to see if, on average, there will be a change in the outcome given a treatment. A *mechanistic data analysis* tries to see if there is an effect that will always occur. If you change the resistance of a brake pad, then given a certain set of conditions you would expect the change it brings to be the same every time. This type of analysis is largely limited to engineering projects.
** What are some common mistakes people make when doing a data analysis?
*** Why does correlation not imply causation when doing inference?
    When you do an inferential analysis you are seeing if there is some kind of a relationship between variables, but without doing a randomized study you can't tell if one variable is /causing/ a change in another. The author Tyler Vigen has [[http://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations][a web-site]] illustrating corellations taken from real data-sources that appear to be entirely unrelated.
*** What is overfitting in an exploratory analysis?
    If you try to interpret an exploratory analysis as predictive, then you are likely going to overfit the data. You should keep the training data for your model separated from your testing data so that you don't fit your model to the specific sub-set of data you have.
*** What is an /n of 1/ analysis?
    *n of 1* refers to the common mistake of trying to infer things about the population from a single (anecdotal) example. In order to make an inferential analysis you need a large data set that is representative of your population of interest.
*** What is /data dredging/?
    This is also known as /p-hacking/ and refers to the practice of repeatedly changing your hypothesis while testing the same data-set until you find something with statistical significance. The data used to construct the hypothesis (the exploratory data) should always be different from the data used to test the hypothesis.
* What is tidy data?
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidy_data][Tidy Data]] is a concept characterized by [[http://hadley.nz/][Hadley Wickham]] in a paper called, appropriately enough, [[https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10][Tidy Data]]. It is a way of organizing the data to makey it easy to share, use in computation, and analyze.
** What makes up a data set?
   These are the components of a dataset that has been processed:

   1. The raw data
   2. A tidy data set
   3. A code book that describes each variable and its values in the tidy data set
   4. An explicit and exact recipe to go from the raw data to a tidy data set followed by a code book
** What is Raw Data?
   This is data that you haven't changed in any way, exactly as it was recorded.
** Why is Raw Data relative?
   Sometimes the raw data needs to have at least some processing to be useful. If it's in a format you can't interpret, for instance, you won't be able to work with it until it has had at least some pre-processing. You want it to be as raw as possible, but it still has to be usable.
** What are the four priciples of Tidy Data?
   1. Each variable should be in one column
   2. Each observation should be in a different row
   3. There should be one table for each "type" of variable
   4. If you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the table that allows you to link them
** What should the first row in the data be?
** How should you share it if you are using Excel?
** What is a code book?
** How do you create an instruction list or script?
** What is the ideal instruction list?
** What do you have to include if you don't include a script?
** What are some common errors people make when creating tidy data?
* Checking the data
* Exploratory analysis
* Statistical modeling and inference
* Prediction and machine learning
* Causality
* Written analyses
* Creating figures
* Presenting data
* Reproducibility
* A few matters of form
* The data analysis checklist
** Answering The Question [/]
   - [ ] Did you specify the type of data analytic question (e.g. exploration, association causality) before touching the data?
   - [ ] Did you define the metric for success before beginning?
   - [ ] Did you understand the context for the question and the scientific or business application?
   - [ ] Did you record the experimental design?
   - [ ] Did you consider whether the question could be answered with the available data?
** Checking the Data
   - [ ] Did you plot univariate and multivariate summaries of the data?
   - [ ] Did you check for outliers?
   - [ ] Did you identify the missing data code?
** Tidying the data
   - [ ] Is each variable one column?
   - [ ] Is each observation one row?
   - [ ] Do different data types appear in each table?
   - [ ] Did you record the recipe for moving from raw to tidy data?
   - [ ] Did you create a code book?
   - [ ] Did you record all parameters, units, and functions applied to the data?
** Exploratory analysis
   - [ ] Did you identify missing values?
   - [ ] Did you make univariate plots?
     + Histograms
     + Density Plots
     + Boxplots
   - [ ] Did you consider correlations between variables (scatterplots)?
   - [ ] Did you check the units of all data points to make user they are in the right range?
   - [ ] Did you consider plotting on a log scale?
   - [ ] Would a scatterplot be more informative?
