* Should we play it safe and do what we're told if we want to succeed?
* Do nice guys finish last?
* Do quitters never win and winners never quit?
* It's not what you know, it's who you know (unless it really is what you know)
* Believe in yourself... sometimes
* Work, work, work... or work-life balance?
* What makes a successful life?
