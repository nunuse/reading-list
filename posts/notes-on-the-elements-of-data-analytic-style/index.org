** Answering The Question [/]
   - [ ] Did you specify the type of data analytic question (e.g. exploration, association causality) before touching the data?
   - [ ] Did you define the metric for success before beginning?
   - [ ] Did you understand the context for the question and the scientific or business application?
   - [ ] Did you record the experimental design?
   - [ ] Did you consider whether the question could be answered with the available data?
** Checking the Data
   - [ ] Did you plot univariate and multivariate summaries of the data?
   - [ ] Did you check for outliers?
   - [ ] Did you identify the missing data code?
** Tidying the data
   - [ ] Is each variable one column?
   - [ ] Is each observation one row?
   - [ ] Do different data types appear in each table?
   - [ ] Did you record the recipe for moving from raw to tidy data?
   - [ ] Did you create a code book?
   - [ ] Did you record all parameters, units, and functions applied to the data?
** Exploratory analysis
   - [ ] Did you identify missing values?
   - [ ] Did you make univariate plots?
     + Histograms
     + Density Plots
     + Boxplots
   - [ ] Did you consider correlations between variables (scatterplots)?
   - [ ] Did you check the units of all data points to make user they are in the right range?
   - [ ] Did you consider plotting on a log scale?
   - [ ] Would a scatterplot be more informative?
